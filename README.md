## Problem Statement üî¥
The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive financial management web application that empowers users to efficiently track their expenses, set financial goals, and improve their financial health. The existing financial management tools often lack personalised insights and smart expense analysis, leading users to struggle with budgeting and achieving their financial objectives.
